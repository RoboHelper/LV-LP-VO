            <h2>What Personal Data We Collect and Why</h2>

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, along with the
                visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string. This information helps us identify and prevent spam.
            </p>
            <p>An anonymized hash created from your email address might be provided to the Gravatar service to check if
                you use it. Review the Gravatar service privacy policy for details. After your comment is approved, your
                profile picture becomes visible to the public alongside your comment.</p>

            <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>If you upload images to the website, please avoid including embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Visitors
                can download and extract location data from website images.</p>

            <h3>Contact Forms</h3>
            <p>We use contact forms to facilitate communication with you. The data collected may include your name,

            <h2>How Long We Retain Your Data</h2>
